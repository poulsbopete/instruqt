title: Elastic Serverless - Security
teaser: "\U0001F6A8 Ready to make Elastic Security light up like a pinball machine?
  \U0001F6A8"
description: "Join our bite‑size Instruqt lab: “Serverless Security – Attack & Detect
  in 15 Minutes” and watch alerts explode in real time as you unleash Atomic Red Team
  on a freshly minted Elastic Serverless project.\n\n\U0001F9E8 What you’ll pull off\n-
  Fire live MITRE ATT&CK TTPs (no malware, all science).\n- See the Detection Engine
  go full Christmas‑tree mode—host, network, cloud signals popping in seconds.\n-
  Pivot from alert ➡️ Timeline ➡️ case management faster than you can say “PowerShell
  obfuscation.”\n\n\U0001F6E0️ What’s in the sandbox\n- One-click Elastic Agent with
  Defend.\n- Curated Atomic tests (process injection, credential dumping, C2 beacon).\n-
  Zero infrastructure to clean up—serverless FTW.\n\n⚡ Why you should care\nBecause
  “hello world” demos are so 2020. Show your team, boss, or next‑door SOC how quickly
  real‑world attacks get squashed when Elastic’s detections run in hyperscale serverless
  land."
